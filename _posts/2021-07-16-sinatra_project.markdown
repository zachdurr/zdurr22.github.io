Creating my Sinatra project was fun, difficult, amazing, totally agonizing at times but ultimately an awesome way to utilize my new Ruby, SQL, ERB, HTML skills. 

The hardest part of this project for me was deciding what I wanted my website to do. My CLI Gem revolved around baseball so I wanted to stick with that pattern and was how I ultimately decided to make a site that a user can login and create a team with players. I play a lot of fantasy baseball so I thought it would be cool to have and be able to create a literal fantasy team with whichever players I wanted. 

Now the fun part- coding it! I realized quickly that I hadn't done any labs or assignments in the past that had multiple layers of "belongs_to" (meaning teams belong to users and players belong to teams). It was only one more level than I had gone so I figured it wouldn't be overly challenging - boy was I wrong! And I have the video to prove it! (My video link for this project was basically 20 minutes of me trying to figure out how to properly create a new player while also assigning it to a team). Anyway once the bugs were sorted out and the website was functional it was very cool to allow my fiance to create her own team with her own players! 

This project made me really appreaciate the beauty of the fantasy sports sites I currently use and certainly makes me want to learn more so that I can create one that's more realistic.
