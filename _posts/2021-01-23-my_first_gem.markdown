Where to begin?

My only experience with coding is a class I took my freshman year of college (in 2009) where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and javascript. The class itself was a bit overwhelming; little did I know that my computer science class would be the equivalent of taking a new language. Fast forward to the end of college and I had my sights set on working for my family's construction business. I did that until 2018 when, due to some unfortunate circumstances, the business was no longable a viable option for my career. So I moved on to a new job in construction and continued my growth as a Project Manager. It didn't take long for me to realize that I didn't *LOVE* construction but what had drew me to it in the first place was the fact that I was helping my family. I started getting bored at night and stumbing through the code academy classes which triggered a familiar memory of learning the language of code years ago. It wasn't long after then before a couple friends of mine turned me on to Flatiron.

I applied immediately and was infatuated by the opportunity to potentially change my career and more importantly my life. It wasn't until I started getting into my first labs when I realized the satisfaction I got from passing the tests was far greater than any feeling I had during my time in construction. So on I went cruising through the README's and labs absorbing all the information I could. The problem I was running into was balancing my school work while still maintaining my 40 hours/week job. 

It hadn't took too much of a toll until my first portfolio project- which brings us to this blog. The idea of starting a project from scratch was so daunting it took a me a week just to muster up the courage to begin. Once I did begin and realized all the resources (videos, online support, help from friends, etc.) it started to feel less overwhelming. Almost a month later and I'm ready to submit my project, albeit there are still some thing I'd like to go back to and add when I have the chance. 

I'm proud of the work that I put into this project and look forward to the applications it can have, along with future projects I build now that I got my first out of the way.
